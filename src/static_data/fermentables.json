      "description": "Simpsons DRC™ has been several years in the making. Using our years of roasting experience, knowledge of malt flavor profiles and pilot roasting facilities, we have managed to produce this unique malt. This malt is at the darker end of our Caramel malt spectrum, however imparts a colour and an intense sweet malty aroma second to none which must be experienced to be believed. This new malt has the classic Simpsons Malt house feel and instantly breaks down in the palate once chewed. It has a distinctive aroma and flavour that is very complex and imparts a heavy, dark caramel taste with more subtle notes of burnt sugar, raisin, and dark dried fruits such as cherries and plums. It can also deliver some of the softer roasty notes of a chocolate or black malt but without the astringency or bitterness. Simpsons DRC™ will produce a deep brown colour with ruddy highlights and add body and foam stability like all caramel malts. Use it to brew traditional Belgian Abbey and Trappist Ales, Dubbels and Dark Strong Ales, but also try it in UK Brown Ales, Stouts, Porters and or any other dark beers, to add an extra layer of complexity. Colour: 280 - 320˚ EBC, 100 – 120˚ Lovibond.",

      "description": "Rahr Red Wheat is a pale wheat malt made from North American winter red wheat. Pale wheat malt has the sweet malty flavor of other malted grains, but with a hint of fruitiness. Wheat malts are high in protein, which helps produce fuller-bodied beers. Wheat malt can improve head formation and retention, depending upon the other grist constituents. Red wheat has a slight tartness to its flavor not present in white wheat. It also has smaller, harder kernels than white wheat, which can require careful milling. Rahr Red Wheat is suitable for all wheat-style beers.",
